### Categorizing Security Vulnerabilities

Most software security vulnerabilities fall into one of the following categories:

+ `Buffer overflow` – This vulnerability occurs when data is written beyond the limits of a buffer. 
+ Buffers are memory areas allocated to an application. 
+ By changing data beyond the boundaries of a buffer, 
+ the application accesses memory allocated to other processes. 
+ This can lead to a system crash, data compromise, 
+ or provide escalation of privileges.

+ `Non-validated input` – Programs often work with data input. 
+ This data coming into the program could have malicious content, 
+ designed to force the program to behave in an unintended way. 
+ Consider a program that receives an image for processing. 
+ A malicious user could craft an image file with invalid image dimensions. 
+ The maliciously crafted dimensions could force the program 
+ to allocate buffers of incorrect and unexpected sizes.

+ `Race conditions` – This vulnerability is when the output of an event depends on ordered or timed outputs. 
+ A race condition becomes a source of vulnerability 
+ when the required ordered or timed events do not occur in the correct order or proper timing.

+ `Weaknesses in security practices` – Systems and sensitive data can be protected through 
+ techniques such as authentication, authorization, and encryption.
+ Developers should not attempt to create their own security algorithms 
+ because it will likely introduce vulnerabilities. 
+ It is strongly advised that developers use `security libraries` 
+ that have already created, tested, and verified.

+ `Access-control problems` – Access control is the process of controlling who does what and
+ ranges from managing physical access to equipment to dictating who has access to a resource, 
+ such as a file, and what they can do with it, 
+ such as read or change the file. 
+ Many security vulnerabilities are created by the improper use of access controls.

+ Nearly all access controls and security practices can be overcome 
+ if the attacker has physical access to target equipment. 
+ For example, no matter what you set a file’s permissions to, 
+ the operating system cannot prevent someone from bypassing the operating system and 
+ reading the data directly off the disk. 
+ To protect the machine and the data it contains, 
+ physical access must be restricted and 
+ encryption techniques must be used to protect data from being stolen or corrupted.
