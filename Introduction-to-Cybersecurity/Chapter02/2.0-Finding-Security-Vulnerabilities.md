### Finding Security Vulnerabilities
```
+ Security vulnerabilities are any kind of software or hardware defect. 
+ After gaining knowledge of a vulnerability, malicious users attempt to exploit it. 
+ An exploit is the term used to describe a program written to take advantage of a known vulnerability. 
+ The act of using an exploit against a vulnerability is referred to as an attack. 
+ The goal of the attack is to gain access to a system, the data it hosts or to a specific resource.

### Software vulnerabilities
```
+ Software vulnerabilities are usually introduced by errors in the operating system or application code, 
+ despite all the effort companies put into finding and patching software vulnerabilities, 
+ it is common for new vulnerabilities to surface.
+ Microsoft, Apple, and other operating system producers release patches and updates almost every day. 
+ Application updates are also common. 
+ Applications such as web browsers, mobile apps and 
+ web servers are often updated by the companies or organizations responsible for them.
```
+ In 2015, a major vulnerability, called `SYNful Knock`, was discovered in Cisco IOS. 
+ This vulnerability allowed attackers to gain control of enterprise-grade routers, 
+ such as the legacy Cisco 1841, 2811, and 3825 routers. 
+ The attackers could then monitor all network communication and 
+ had the ability to infect other network devices. 
+ This vulnerability was introduced into the system 
+ when an altered IOS version was installed in the routers. 
+ To avoid this, always verify the integrity of the downloaded IOS image and 
+ limit the physical access of the equipment to authorized personnel only.

+ `The goal of software updates is to stay current and avoid exploitation of vulnerabilities.`
+  While some companies have `penetration testing teams` dedicated to search, 
+  find and patch software vulnerabilities before they can get exploited, 
+  third party security researchers also specialize in finding vulnerabilities in software.

+ `Googleâ€™s Project Zero is a great example of such practice.`
+ After discovering a number of vulnerabilities in various software used by end-users, 
+ Google formed a permanent team dedicated to finding software vulnerabilities. 
+ Google Security Research can be found [here](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/google-security-research/issues/list?can=1&q=).

### Hardware vulnerabilities

+ Hardware vulnerabilities are often introduced by hardware design flaws.
+ `RAM memory for example, is essentially capacitors installed very close to one another.` 
+ It was discovered that, due to proximity, 
+ constant changes applied to one of these capacitors could influence neighbor capacitors. 
+ Based on that design flaw, an exploit called `Rowhammer` was created. 
+ By repeatedly rewriting memory in the same addresses, 
+ the Rowhammer exploit allows data to be retrieved from nearby address memory cells, even if the cells are protected.

+ Hardware vulnerabilities are specific to device models and 
+ are not generally exploited through random compromising attempts. 
+ While hardware exploits are more common in highly targeted attacks, 
+ traditional malware protection and 
+ a physical security are sufficient protection for the everyday user.
