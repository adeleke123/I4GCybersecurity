## Security Breach Example 3

+ Equifax Inc. is one of the nationwide consumer credit reporting agencies in the United States. 
+ This company collects information on millions of individual customers and businesses worldwide. 
+ Based on the collected information, credit scores and credit reports are created about the customers. 
+ This information could affect the customers when they apply for loans and when they are looking for employment.

+ In September 2017, Equifax publicly announced a data breach event. 
+ The attackers exploited a vulnerability in the Apache Struts web application software. 
+ The company believes that millions of U.S. consumers' sensitive personal data were accessed by the cyber criminals between May and July of 2017. 
+ The personal data includes the customers' full names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and 
+ other personally identifiable information. 
+ There is evidence that the breach may have affected customers in United Kingdom and Canada.

+ Equifax established a dedicated web site that allows the consumers to determine if their information was compromised, 
+ and to sign up for credit monitoring and identity theft protection. 
+ Using a new domain name, instead of using a subdomain of equifax.com, 
+ this allowed nefarious parties to create unauthorized websites with similar names. 
+ These websites can be used as part of a phishing scheme to trick you into providing personal information. 
+ Furthermore, an employee from Equifax provided an incorrect web link in social media for worried customers. 
+ Fortunately, this web site was taken down within 24 hours. 
+ It was created by an individual who use it as an educational opportunity to expose the vulnerabilities that exists in Equifax's response page.

+ As a concerned consumer, you may want to quickly verify if your information was compromised, 
+ so you can minimize the impact. In a time of crisis, you may be tricked into using unauthorized websites.
+ You should be cautious about providing personal information so you do not become a victim again. 
+ Furthermore, companies are responsible for keeping our information safe from unauthorized access. 
+ Companies need to regularly patch and update their software to mitigate exploitation of known vulnerabilities. 
+ Their employees should be educated and informed about the procedures to safeguard the information and what to do in the event of a breach.

+ Unfortunately, the real victims of this breach are the individuals whose data may have been compromised. 
+ In this case, Equifax has the burden of protecting the collected consumer data while conducting credit checks because 
+ the customers did not choose to use the services provided by Equifax. 
+ The consumer has to trust the company to safeguard the collected information. 
+ Furthermore, the attackers can use this data to assume your identity, and 
+ it is very difficult to prove otherwise because both the attacker and 
+ the victim know the same information. In these situations, 
+ the most you can do is be vigilant when you are providing personally identifiable information over the Internet. 
+ Check your credit reports regularly (once per month or once per quarter). 
+ Immediately report any false information, such as applications for credit that you did not initiate, 
+ or purchases on your credit cards that you did not make.
