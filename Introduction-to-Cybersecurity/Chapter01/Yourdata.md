## Where is Your Data?

+ All of this information is about you. 
+ There are different laws that protect your privacy and 
+ data in your country. But do you know where your data is?

+ When you are at the doctorâ€™s office, 
+ the conversation you have with the doctor is recorded in your medical chart. 
+ For billing purposes, this information may be shared with the insurance company to ensure appropriate billing and quality. 
+ Now, a part of your medical record for the visit is also at the insurance company.

+ The store loyalty cards maybe a convenient way to save money for your purchases. 
+ However, the store is compiling a profile of your purchases and using that information for its own use. 
+ The profile shows a buyer purchases a certain brand and flavor of toothpaste regularly. 
+ The store uses this information to target the buyer with special offers from the marketing partner. 
+ By using the loyalty card, the store and the marketing partner have a profile for the purchasing behavior of a customer.

+ When you share your pictures online with your friends, 
+ do you know who may have a copy of the pictures? 
+ Copies of the pictures are on your own devices. 
+ Your friends may have copies of those pictures downloaded onto their devices. 
+ If the pictures are shared publicly, strangers may have copies of them, too. 
+ They could download those pictures or take screenshots of those pictures. 
+ Because the pictures were posted online, 
+ they are also saved on servers located in different parts of the world. 
+ Now the pictures are no longer only found on your computing devices.
