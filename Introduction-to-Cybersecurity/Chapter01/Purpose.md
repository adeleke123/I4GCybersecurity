## The Purpose of Cyberwarfare

+ The main purpose of cyberwarfare is to gain advantage over adversaries, whether they are nations or competitors.

+ A nation can continuously invade other nation’s infrastructure, steal defense secrets, and 
+ gather information about technology to narrow the gaps in its industries and military. 
+ Besides industrial and militaristic espionage, 
+ cyberwar can sabotage the infrastructure of other nations and cost lives in the targeted nations. 
+ For example, an attack can disrupt the power grid of a major city. 
+ Traffic would be disrupted. The exchange of goods and services is halted. 
+ Patients cannot get the care needed in emergency situations. 
+ Access to the Internet may also be disrupted. By affecting the power grid, the attack can affect the everyday life of ordinary citizens.

+ Furthermore, compromised sensitive data can give the attackers the ability to blackmail personnel within the government. 
+ The information may allow an attacker to pretend to be an authorized user to access sensitive information or equipment.

+ If the government cannot defend against the cyberattacks, 
+ the citizens may lose confidence in the government’s ability to protect them. 
+ Cyberwarfare can destabilize a nation, disrupt commerce, and 
+ affect the citizens’ faith in their government without ever physically invading the targeted nation.
