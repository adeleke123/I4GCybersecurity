## Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability

+ Confidentiality, integrity and availability, known as the CIA triad,
+ is a guideline for information security for an organization. 
+ Confidentiality ensures the privacy of data by restricting access through authentication encryption. 
+ Integrity assures that the information is accurate and trustworthy. 
+ Availability ensures that the information is accessible to authorized people.

### Confidentiality

+ Another term for confidentiality would be privacy. 
+ Company policies should restrict access to the information to authorized personnel and 
+ ensure that only those authorized individuals view this data. 
+ The data may be compartmentalized according to the security or sensitivity level of the information. 
+ For example, a Java program developer should not have to access to the personal information of all employees. 
+ Furthermore, employees should receive training to understand the best practices 
+ in safeguarding sensitive information to protect themselves and the company from attacks. 
+ Methods to ensure confidentiality include data encryption, 
+ username ID and password, two factor authentication, and minimizing exposure of sensitive information.

### Integrity

+ Integrity is accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of the data during its entire life cycle. 
+ Data must be unaltered during transit and not changed by unauthorized entities. 
+ File permissions and user access control can prevent unauthorized access. 
+ Version control can be used to prevent accidental changes by authorized users. 
+ Backups must be available to restore any corrupted data, and 
+ checksum hashing can be used to verify integrity of the data during transfer.

+ A checksum is used to verify the integrity of files, or strings of characters, 
+ after they have been transferred from one device to another across your local network or the Internet. 
+ Checksums are calculated with hash functions. 
+ Some of the common checksums are `MD5`, `SHA-1`, `SHA-256`, and `SHA-512`.
+ A hash function uses a mathematical algorithm to transform the data into fixed-length value that represents the data.
+ The hashed value is simply there for comparison. 
+ From the hashed value, the original data cannot be retrieved directly. 
+ For example, if you forgot your password, your password cannot be recovered from the hashed value. The password must be reset.

+ After a file is downloaded, you can verify its integrity by verifying the hash values 
+ from the source with the one you generated using any hash calculator. 
+ By comparing the hash values, you can ensure that the file has not been tampered with or corrupted during the transfer.

### Availability

+ Maintaining equipment, performing hardware repairs, keeping operating systems and software up to date, and 
+ creating backups ensure the availability of the network and data to the authorized users. 
+ Plans should be in place to recover quickly from natural or man-made disasters. 
+ Security equipment or software, such as firewalls, guard against downtime due to attacks such as denial of service (DoS). 
+ Denial of service occurs when an attacker attempts to overwhelm resources so the services are not available to the users.
