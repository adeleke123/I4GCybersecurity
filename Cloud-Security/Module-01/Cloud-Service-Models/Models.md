## NIST Models of cloud computing

The model of cloud computing can be understood by examining its `essential characteristics`, `service models`, and `deployment models`. Let's explore each of these components in detail:

### Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing:

+ `On-Demand Self-Service:` Cloud computing provides self-service capabilities, allowing users to provision and manage computing resources, such as virtual machines, storage, and applications, without requiring human intervention from the service provider.

+ `Broad Network Access:` Cloud services are accessible over the network and can be accessed by various devices, including laptops, smartphones, and tablets, using standard protocols.

+ `Resource Pooling:` Cloud computing utilizes a multi-tenant model, where computing resources are pooled and shared among multiple users. The resources can be dynamically assigned and reassigned to meet varying demands while maintaining a high level of efficiency.

+ `Rapid Elasticity:` Cloud services have the ability to scale resources up or down rapidly based on demand. This allows users to quickly allocate additional resources during peak periods and release them when no longer needed, ensuring efficient resource utilization.

+ `Measured Service:` Cloud providers offer usage-based billing and metering, allowing users to pay for the resources they consume. Service usage is monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency and enabling cost optimization.

### Service Models of Cloud Computing:

+ `Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):` IaaS provides virtualized computing resources, such as virtual machines, storage, and networks, to users. It gives users the flexibility to manage and control the underlying infrastructure while offloading the physical infrastructure maintenance and management to the cloud provider.

+ `Platform as a Service (PaaS):` PaaS offers a platform that includes an operating system, development tools, and runtime environments to support application development and deployment. Users can focus on building and deploying applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

+ `Software as a Service (SaaS):` SaaS delivers fully functional applications over the internet on a pay-per-use basis. Users can access and use the software applications provided by the cloud provider without the need for installation, maintenance, or infrastructure management.


### Deployment Models of Cloud Computing:

+ `Public Cloud:` Public cloud services are provided by third-party cloud providers and are accessible over the internet to the general public. Resources are shared among multiple users, and the infrastructure is owned and managed by the cloud provider.

+ `Private Cloud:` Private cloud is dedicated to a single organization and can be hosted either on-premises or by a third-party provider. It offers more control, security, and customization options, as the infrastructure is dedicated to a specific organization.

+ `Hybrid Cloud:` Hybrid cloud combines the use of both public and private cloud resources, allowing organizations to leverage the benefits of both models. It enables workload portability and allows for more flexibility in terms of resource allocation, scalability, and data placement.

+ `Community Cloud:` Community cloud is shared among multiple organizations with similar requirements, such as security or compliance needs. It allows these organizations to share infrastructure resources while maintaining their specific requirements.

In summary, the model of cloud computing encompasses essential characteristics such as on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service. It offers service models like Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Additionally, cloud computing can be deployed in various ways, including public, private, hybrid, and community clouds, based on organizational needs and preferences.
