## IaaS

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud computing service model that provides virtualized computing resources to users over the internet. Let's break down IaaS from different perspectives:

+ `Facilities:` IaaS providers own and manage the physical data centers that house the infrastructure. These data centers are equipped with power, cooling, networking, and security systems to ensure the reliable and secure operation of the infrastructure.

+ `Hardware:` The IaaS provider is responsible for procuring, deploying, and maintaining the underlying hardware infrastructure. This includes servers, storage devices, networking equipment, and other components required for running virtualized environments. The hardware is managed by the provider to deliver reliable performance and scalability.

+ `Abstraction:` IaaS abstracts the underlying hardware infrastructure, providing users with virtualized resources that mimic physical infrastructure. Users can access and manage virtual machines (VMs), storage volumes, and networks that are provisioned on the IaaS platform. This abstraction allows users to focus on their applications and services without the need to manage physical hardware.

+ `Core Connectivity:` IaaS providers establish robust core connectivity within their data centers to ensure high-speed and reliable network connectivity between different components of the infrastructure. This connectivity facilitates efficient data transfer, intercommunication between virtualized resources, and integration with other services.

+ `Delivery to APIs:` IaaS platforms expose Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that enable users to interact with and control the virtualized resources. Users can programmatically provision, configure, monitor, and manage their infrastructure using these APIs. The APIs provide a standardized interface for users to interact with the IaaS platform, enabling automation and integration with other systems.

Through IaaS, users have flexibility and control over the virtualized infrastructure without the burden of managing physical hardware. They can dynamically provision and scale virtual resources based on demand, configure networking and security settings, and deploy their applications and services. The IaaS provider handles the infrastructure management, including hardware maintenance, data center operations, and core connectivity, allowing users to focus on their applications and business objectives.
