Multitenancy refers to the capability of a software or system to serve multiple users, known as tenants, while maintaining logical and physical isolation between them. In the context of cloud computing, `multitenancy` is a fundamental concept that enables the efficient sharing of computing resources among multiple users or organizations.

In a multitenant environment, the infrastructure and resources are shared by multiple tenants, but each tenant's data, applications, and configurations are logically separated and isolated from one another. This isolation ensures that each tenant operates within its own secure and private environment, without being able to access or interfere with the resources of other tenants.

### Key characteristics of multitenancy include:

+ `Resource Sharing:` Multitenancy allows multiple tenants to share a common infrastructure, including servers, storage, networks, and other computing resources. This sharing enables more efficient resource utilization and cost optimization.

+ `Data Isolation:` Each tenant's data is segregated and isolated from other tenants, ensuring privacy and preventing unauthorized access. Data is stored separately, and security mechanisms are in place to maintain data confidentiality and integrity.

+ `Customization and Configuration:` Multitenant systems allow tenants to customize and configure their own applications, settings, and preferences within their isolated environments. Each tenant can tailor their experience and functionalities without affecting other tenants.

+ `Scalability and Elasticity:` Multitenancy supports dynamic scalability and elasticity, allowing resources to be allocated or scaled up/down based on the needs of individual tenants. This flexibility ensures that each tenant has access to the necessary resources without impacting others.

+ `Maintenance Efficiency:` With multitenancy, maintenance and updates can be performed more efficiently. Upgrades and patches can be applied to the shared infrastructure, benefiting all tenants simultaneously, without requiring individual updates for each tenant.

Multitenancy is widely used in cloud computing environments, enabling cloud service providers to serve multiple customers efficiently and cost-effectively. It allows for economies of scale, improved resource utilization, and simplified management and maintenance. By leveraging multitenancy, cloud providers can deliver services to a large number of customers while ensuring data isolation and security between tenants.
