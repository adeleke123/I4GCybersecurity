## Shared Responsibilities

`The Shared Responsibility Model` is a fundamental concept in cloud computing that outlines the distribution of security responsibilities between cloud service providers (CSPs) and their customers. It defines which aspects of security and management are the responsibility of the cloud provider and which are the responsibility of the cloud customer. This model helps to establish clear boundaries and expectations regarding security measures, ensuring a collaborative approach to maintaining a secure cloud environment.

The exact division of responsibilities can vary depending on the cloud service model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and the specific cloud provider. However, the general principles remain consistent:

### Cloud Provider Responsibilities:

+ `Infrastructure Security:` The cloud provider is responsible for securing the physical data centers, network infrastructure, and the underlying hardware on which the cloud services run. This includes measures like access control, environmental controls, and network security.
+ `Virtualization Security:` For Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offerings, the cloud provider is responsible for securing the hypervisor and ensuring that virtual machines are isolated from each other.
+ `Platform Security:` In Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings, the cloud provider is responsible for securing the platform components, such as the runtime environment, database management system, and development frameworks.
+ `Application Security:` For Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings, the cloud provider is responsible for securing the application and its infrastructure.
+ `Data Center Controls:` Physical access controls, monitoring, and disaster recovery mechanisms are typically the responsibility of the cloud provider.
+ `Network Security:` The cloud provider is responsible for securing the cloud's global network infrastructure.
### Cloud Customer Responsibilities:

+ `Data Security:` The customer is responsible for securing their data, both in transit and at rest. This includes data encryption, access controls, and data integrity.
+ `Identity and Access Management (IAM):` The customer is responsible for managing user access to their cloud resources and ensuring proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place.
+ `Application Security:` In a PaaS or IaaS model, the customer is responsible for securing the applications and workloads they deploy on the cloud platform.
+ `Operating System Security:` In an IaaS model, the customer is responsible for securing the operating system of virtual machines they deploy.
+ `Configuration Management:` The customer is responsible for properly configuring and managing their cloud resources to ensure security best practices are followed.
+ `Compliance and Data Governance:` The customer is responsible for adhering to regulatory requirements and implementing data governance policies.
It is essential for cloud customers to understand their responsibilities within the Shared Responsibility Model and take appropriate measures to protect their data, applications, and systems hosted in the cloud. By working in partnership with the cloud provider and following best security practices, organizations can ensure a more secure and resilient cloud computing environment.
