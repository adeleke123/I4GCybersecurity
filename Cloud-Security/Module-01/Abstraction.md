## Abstraction(Virtualization)

Abstraction plays a crucial role in hypervisors, software-defined networking (SDN), and storage abstraction. Let's explore how abstraction is related to each of these concepts:

+ `Hypervisor Abstraction:` Hypervisors provide a layer of abstraction between the underlying physical hardware and the virtual machines (VMs) running on top of it. The hypervisor abstracts the hardware resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, and presents them as virtualized resources to the VMs. This abstraction allows multiple VMs to run concurrently on a single physical server, each with its own isolated and virtualized set of resources.
By abstracting the hardware, hypervisors enable VMs to be portable, independent of the underlying physical infrastructure. This abstraction simplifies the management and allocation of resources, allowing administrators to dynamically provision, migrate, and scale VMs across different physical servers without impacting the applications running within the VMs.

+ `Software-Defined Networking (SDN) Abstraction:` SDN abstracts the network infrastructure by separating the control plane and the data plane. The control plane, managed by software controllers, centralizes the network management and control decisions, while the data plane handles the actual forwarding of network traffic.
Through abstraction, SDN provides a simplified and programmable view of the network, decoupling the network logic from the underlying physical network devices. Network administrators can define network policies, traffic flows, and services in a centralized manner, regardless of the underlying network infrastructure. This abstraction enables greater flexibility, scalability, and programmability in managing and configuring networks.

+ `Storage Abstraction:` Storage abstraction involves abstracting the complexities of the underlying physical storage infrastructure to provide a simplified and unified view of storage resources. It enables efficient management and allocation of storage resources in cloud environments.
Storage abstraction allows administrators to define storage pools, virtual volumes, or object storage buckets, hiding the intricacies of the underlying physical storage devices. By abstracting storage, administrators can allocate and manage storage resources at a higher level, without needing to be concerned with the specific details of the underlying hardware.

This abstraction provides benefits such as improved storage resource utilization, simplified management and provisioning, and the ability to provision storage resources based on specific requirements or service-level agreements.

In summary, abstraction is a key aspect of hypervisors, SDN, and storage abstraction. It allows for the virtualization and simplification of underlying hardware and infrastructure, providing higher-level views and management capabilities that enhance flexibility, scalability, and resource allocation in cloud computing environments.
