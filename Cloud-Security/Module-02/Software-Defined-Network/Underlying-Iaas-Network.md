## Underlying Iaas Network

In Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), the underlying network refers to the network infrastructure and components that are responsible for managing the connectivity, storage, and device communication within the IaaS environment. Here's a breakdown of each aspect:

+ Network Management: The underlying network in IaaS involves the management of network resources and configurations. This includes tasks such as setting up and configuring virtual networks, defining subnets, assigning IP addresses, configuring routing tables, and managing network security groups or firewall rules. Network management ensures the proper functioning and security of the network infrastructure.

+ Storage: In IaaS, the underlying network is responsible for managing storage resources and providing storage capabilities to cloud consumers. This includes managing storage devices, such as disk arrays or storage area networks (SANs), and handling storage provisioning, allocation, and access control. The network facilitates data transfer between storage devices and virtual machines or instances running in the IaaS environment.

+ Device Communication: The underlying network enables communication between devices within the IaaS environment. This includes facilitating connectivity between virtual machines (VMs), containers, or physical servers, allowing them to communicate and exchange data. The network ensures that devices can connect to each other within the IaaS infrastructure, enabling seamless communication and data transfer.

Overall, the underlying network in IaaS plays a vital role in managing network resources, storage provisioning, and facilitating device communication within the infrastructure. It ensures that cloud consumers can establish and manage networks, allocate storage resources, and enable effective communication between their virtual machines and devices in the IaaS environment.
