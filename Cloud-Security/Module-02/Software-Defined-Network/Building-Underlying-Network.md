## Building Underlying Network

Building the underlying networks for cloud infrastructure involves designing and implementing a network architecture that can support the scalability, flexibility, and security requirements of cloud environments. Here are some key considerations and steps involved in building the underlying networks for cloud:

+ Network Architecture Design: Start by designing a network architecture that aligns with the cloud infrastructure requirements. This includes determining the desired network topology, such as flat or hierarchical, and deciding on the appropriate network protocols and technologies to be used, such as VLANs, VPNs, or software-defined networking (SDN).

+ Scalability and Elasticity: Cloud networks should be designed to accommodate scalability and elastic growth. This involves considering factors such as load balancing, network segmentation, and the ability to dynamically allocate network resources as the demand fluctuates. Technologies like virtual networking and network overlays can help achieve scalability and elasticity in cloud networks.

+ Security: Implement robust security measures within the network architecture. This includes incorporating firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), virtual private networks (VPNs), and network access controls to protect against unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats. Encryption should be employed for data in transit and at rest.

+ Redundancy and High Availability: Cloud networks should be designed with redundancy and high availability in mind. This involves implementing redundant network paths, utilizing load balancers, and ensuring failover mechanisms are in place to maintain continuous connectivity and minimize downtime.

+ Network Segmentation and Isolation: Implement network segmentation and isolation to enhance security and resource management. This can be achieved through the use of virtual LANs (VLANs), virtual private clouds (VPCs), or network virtualization technologies. Network segmentation helps separate different types of workloads or tenants, limiting the scope of potential security breaches and enabling better resource management.

+ Monitoring and Management: Implement network monitoring and management tools to gain visibility into the network performance, troubleshoot issues, and optimize resource utilization. This includes deploying network monitoring systems, logging and auditing mechanisms, and network management platforms.

+ Integration with Cloud Services: Ensure seamless integration between the underlying network infrastructure and the cloud services being utilized. This involves configuring networking components to work harmoniously with the cloud provider's services, such as virtual machine instances, storage, and load balancers.

+ Compliance and Governance: Consider any industry-specific compliance requirements and governance frameworks when building cloud networks. Implement appropriate controls, logging mechanisms, and audit trails to meet regulatory obligations and security standards.

Building the underlying networks for cloud infrastructure requires a combination of networking expertise, understanding of cloud architecture, and alignment with the specific requirements of the organization and its cloud deployment. Collaboration between network engineers, cloud architects, and security specialists is essential to create a robust and efficient network foundation for cloud environments
