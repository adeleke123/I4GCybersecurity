## What is Cyberwarfare?

+ Cyberspace has become another important dimension of warfare, 
+ where nations can carry out conflicts without the clashes of traditional troops and machines. 
+ This allows countries with minimal military presence to be as strong as other nations in cyberspace. 
+ Cyberwarfare is an Internet-based conflict that involves the penetration of computer systems and networks of other nations. 
+ These attackers have the resources and expertise to launch massive Internet-based attacks 
+ against other nations to cause damage or disrupt services, such as shutting down a power grid.

+ An example of a state-sponsored attack involved the `Stuxnet malware` that was designed to damage Iranâ€™s nuclear enrichment plant.
+ `Stuxnet malware` did not hijack targeted computers to steal information. 
+ It was designed to damage physical equipment that was controlled by computers. 
+ It used modular coding that was programmed to perform a specific task within the `malware`. 
+ It used stolen digital certificates so the attack appeared legitimate to the system.
