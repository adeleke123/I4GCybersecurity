## Types of Attackers

+ Attackers are individuals or groups who attempt to exploit vulnerability for personal or financial gain. 
+ Attackers are interested in everything, from credit cards to product designs and anything with value.

+ `Amateurs` – These people are sometimes called Script Kiddies. 
+ They are usually attackers with little or no skill, 
+ often using existing tools or instructions found on the Internet to launch attacks. 
+ Some of them are just curious, while others are trying to demonstrate their skills and cause harm. 
+ They may be using basic tools, but the results can still be devastating.

+ `Hackers` – This group of attackers break into computers or networks to gain access. 
+ Depending on the intent of the break-in, these attackers are classified as `white`, `gray`, or `black hats`.
+ The `white hat attackers` break into networks or computer systems to discover weaknesses so that the security of these systems can be improved. 
+ These break-ins are done with prior permission and any results are reported back to the owner. 
+ On the other hand, `black hat attackers` take advantage of any vulnerability for illegal personal, financial or political gain. 
+ `Gray hat attackers` are somewhere between white and black hat attackers. 
+ The gray hat attackers may find a vulnerability in a system. 
+ `Gray hat hackers` may report the vulnerability to the owners of the system if that action coincides with their agenda. 
+ Some gray hat hackers publish the facts about the vulnerability on the Internet so that other attackers can exploit it.

The figure gives details about the terms white hat hacker, black hat hacker, and gray hat hacker.
