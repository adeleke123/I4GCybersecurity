## Your Online and Offline Identity

+ As more time is spent online, your identity, both online and offline, can affect your life. 
+ Your offline identity is the person who your friends and 
+ family interact with on a daily basis at home, at school, or work. 
+ They know your personal information, such as your name, age, or where you live. 
+ Your online identity is who you are in cyberspace. 
+ Your online identity is how you present yourself to others online. 
+ This online identity should only reveal a limited amount of information about you.

+ You should take care when choosing a username or alias for your online identity. 
+ The username should not include any personal information. 
+ It should be something appropriate and respectful. 
+ This username should not lead strangers to think you are an easy target for cybercrimes or unwanted attention.
