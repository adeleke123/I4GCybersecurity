## The Consequences of a Security Breach

+ To protect an organization from every possible cyberattack is not feasible, for a few reasons. 
+ The expertise necessary to set up and maintain the secure network can be expensive. 
+ Attackers will always continue to find new ways to target networks. 
+ Eventually, an advanced and targeted cyberattack will succeed. 
+ The priority will then be how quickly your security team can respond to the attack to minimize the loss of data, downtime, and revenue.

+ By now you know that anything posted online can live online forever, 
+ even if you were able to erase all the copies in your possession. 
+ If your servers were hacked, the confidential personnel information could be made public. 
+ A hacker (or hacking group) may vandalize the company website by posting untrue information and
+ ruin the company’s reputation that took years to build. 
+ The hackers can also take down the company website causing the company to lose revenue. 
+ If the website is down for longer periods of time, the company may appear unreliable and possibly lose credibility. 
+ If the company website or network has been breached, this could lead to leaked confidential documents, 
+ revealed trade secrets, and stolen intellectual property. The loss of all this information may impede company growth and expansion.

+ The monetary cost of a breach is much higher than just replacing any lost or stolen devices, 
+ investing in existing security and strengthening the building’s physical security. 
+ The company may be responsible for contacting all the affected customers about the breach and 
+ may have to be prepared for litigation. 
+ With all this turmoil, employees may choose to leave the company. 
+ The company may need to focus less on growing and more on repairing its reputation.
