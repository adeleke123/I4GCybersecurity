## Internal and External Threats

### Internal Security Threats

+ Attacks can be originated from within an organization or from outside of the organization, as shown in the figure. 
+ An internal user, such as an employee or contract partner, can accidently or intentionally:

### Mishandle confidential data

+ Threaten the operations of internal servers or network infrastructure devices
+ Facilitate outside attacks by connecting infected USB media into the corporate computer system
+ Accidentally invite malware onto the network through malicious email or websites
+ Internal threats also have the potential to cause greater damage than external threats, 
+ because internal users have direct access to the building and its infrastructure devices. 
+ Employees also have knowledge of the corporate network, its resources, and 
+ its confidential data, as well as different levels of user or administrative privileges.

### External Security Threats

+ External threats from amateurs or skilled attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in network or 
+ computing devices, or use social engineering to gain access.
