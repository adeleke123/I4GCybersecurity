## They Want Your Identity

+ Besides stealing your money for a short-term monetary gain, 
+ the criminals want long-term profits by stealing your identity.
+ As medical costs rise, medical identity theft is also on the rise. 
+ The identity thieves can steal your medical insurance and use your medical benefits for themselves, 
+ and these medical procedures are now in your medical records.

+ The annual tax filing procedures may vary from country to country; however, 
+ cybercriminals see this time as an opportunity. For example, 
+ the people of the United States need to file their taxes by April 15 of each year. 
+ The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) does not check the tax return against the information from the employer until July. 
+ An identity thief can file a fake tax return and collect the refund. 
+ The legitimate filers will notice when their returns are rejected by IRS. 
+ With the stolen identity, they can also open credit card accounts and run up debts in your name. 
+ This will cause damage to your credit rating and make it more difficult for you to obtain loans.

+ Personal credentials can also lead to corporate data and government data access.
