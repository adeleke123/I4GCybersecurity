## Your Data

+ Any information about you can be considered to be your data. 
+ This personal information can uniquely identify you as an individual. 
+ This data includes the pictures and messages that you exchange with your family and friends online. 
+ Other information, such as name, social security number, date and 
+ place of birth, or mother‘s maiden name, is known by you and used to identify you. 
+ Information such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information, can also be used to identify you online.

### Medical Records

+ Every time you go to the doctor’s office, more information is added to your electronic health records (EHRs). 
+ The prescription from your family doctor becomes part of your EHR. 
+ Your EHR includes your physical health, mental health, and 
+ other personal information that may not be medically-related. 
+ For example, if you had counseling as a child when there were major changes in the family, 
+ this will be somewhere in your medical records. 
+ Besides your medical history and personal information, 
+ the EHR may also include information about your family.

+ Medical devices, such as fitness bands, use the cloud platform to enable wireless transfer, 
+ storage and display of clinical data like heart rates, blood pressures and blood sugars. 
+ These devices can generate an enormous amount of clinical data that could become part of your medical records.

### Education Records

+ As you progress through your education, information about your grades and 
+ test scores, your attendance, courses taken, awards and 
+ degrees rewarded, and any disciplinary reports may be in your education record. 
+ This record may also include contact information, health and immunization records, and 
+ special education records including individualized education programs (IEPs).

### Employment and Financial Records

+ Your financial record may include information about your income and expenditures. 
+ Tax records could include paycheck stubs, credit card statements, 
+ your credit rating and other banking information. 
+ Your employment information can include your past employment and your performance.
