## Security Breach Example 2

+ The high tech toy maker for children, Vtech, suffered a security breach to its database in November 2015. 
+ This breach could affect millions of customers around the world, including children. 
+ The data breach exposed sensitive information including customer names, email addresses, passwords, pictures, and chat logs.

+ A toy tablet had become a new target for hackers. 
+ The customers had shared photos and used the chat features through the toy tablets. 
+ The information was not secured properly, and the company website did not support secure SSL communication. 
+ Even though the breach did not expose any credit card information and personal identification data, 
+ the company was suspended on the stock exchange because the concern over the hack was so great.

+ Vtech did not safeguard the customers’ information properly and it was exposed during the breach. 
+ Even though the company informed its customers that their passwords had been hashed, 
+ it was still possible for the hackers to decipher them. 
+ The passwords in the database were scrambled using `MD5 hash function`, but 
+ the security questions and answers were stored in plaintext. Unfortunately, 
+ MD5 hash function has known vulnerabilities. 
+ The hackers can determine the original passwords by comparing millions of pre-calculated hash values.

+ With the information exposed in this data breach, 
+ cybercriminals could use it to create email accounts, apply for credits, and 
+ commit crimes before the children were old enough to go to school. 
+ For the parents of these children, 
+ the cybercriminals could take over the online accounts because 
+ many people reuse their passwords on different websites and accounts.

+ The security breach not only impacted the privacy of the customers, 
+ it ruined the company’s reputation, as indicated by the company 
+ when its presence on the stock exchange was suspended.

+ For parents, it is a wake-up call to be more vigilant about their children’s privacy online and 
+ demand better security for children’s products. 
+ For the manufacturers of network-connected products, 
+ they need to be more aggressive in the protection of customer data and 
+ privacy now and in the future, as the cyberattack landscape evolves.
