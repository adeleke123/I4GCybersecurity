### The National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework

The Workforce Framework categorizes cybersecurity work into seven categories.

`Operate and Maintain` includes providing the support, administration, and maintenance required to ensure IT system performance and security.

`Protect and Defend` includes the identification, analysis, and mitigation of threats to internal systems and networks.

`Investigate` includes the investigation of cyber events and/or cyber crimes involving IT resources.

`Collect and Operate` includes specialized denial and deception operations and the collection of cybersecurity information.

`Analyze` includes highly specialized review and evaluation of incoming cybersecurity information to determine if it is useful for intelligence.

`Oversight and Development` provides for leadership, management, and direction to conduct cybersecurity work effectively.

`Securely Provision` includes conceptualizing, designing, and building secure IT systems.

Within each category, there are several specialty areas. The specialty areas then define common types of cybersecurity work.
