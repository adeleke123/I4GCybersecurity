## They Want Your Money

+ If you have anything of value, the criminals want it.

+ Your online credentials are valuable. 
+ These credentials give the thieves access to your accounts. 
+ You may think the frequent flyer miles you have earned are not valuable to cybercriminals. 
+ Think again, After approximately 10,000 American Airlines and United accounts were hacked, 
+ cybercriminals booked free flights and upgrades using these stolen credentials. 
+ Even though the frequent flyer miles were returned to the customers by the airlines, 
+ this demonstrates the value of login credentials. 
+ A criminal could also take advantage of your relationships. 
+ They could access your online accounts and 
+ your reputation to trick you into wiring money to your friends or family. 
+ The criminal can send messages stating that your family or friends need you 
+ to wire them money so they can get home from abroad after losing their wallets.

+ The criminals are very imaginative when they are trying to trick you into giving them money. 
+ They do not just steal your money; they could also steal your identity and ruin your life.
