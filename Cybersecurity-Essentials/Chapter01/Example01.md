## Security Breach Example 1

+ The online password manager, LastPass, detected unusual activity on its network in July 2015. 
+ It turned out that hackers had stolen user email addresses, password reminders, and authentication hashes. 
+ Fortunately for the users, the hackers were unable to obtain anyone’s encrypted password vaults.

+ Even though there was a security breach, LastPass could still safeguard the users’ account information.
+ LastPass requires email verification or multi-factor authentication 
+ whenever there is a new login from an unknown device or IP address. 
+ The hackers would also need the master password to access the account.

+ LastPass users also have some responsibility in safeguarding their own accounts. 
+ The users should always use complex master passwords and change the master passwords periodically. 
+ The users should always beware of Phishing attacks. 
+ An example of a Phishing attack would be if an attacker sent fake emails claiming to be from LastPass. 
+ The emails ask the users to click an embedded link and change the password. 
+ The link in the email goes to a fraudulent version of the website used to steal the master password. 
+ The users should never click the embedded links in an email. 
+ The users should also be careful with their password reminder. 
+ The password reminder should not give away your passwords. 
+ Most importantly, the users should enable multi-factor authentication when available for any website that offers it.

+ If the users and service providers both utilize the proper tools and procedures to safeguard the users’ information, 
+ the users’ data could still be protected, even in the event of security breach.
