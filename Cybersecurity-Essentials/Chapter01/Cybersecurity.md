## What is Cybersecurity?

+ The connected electronic information network has become an integral part of our daily lives.
+ All types of organizations, such as medical, financial, and 
+ education institutions, use this network to operate effectively.
+ They utilize the network by collecting, processing, storing, and 
+ sharing vast amounts of digital information. 
+ As more digital information is gathered and shared, the protection of this information 
+ is becoming even more vital to our national security and economic stability.

+ Cybersecurity is the ongoing effort to protect these networked systems and 
+ all of the data from unauthorized use or harm. 
+ On a personal level, you need to safeguard your identity, your data, and 
+ your computing devices. At the corporate level, 
+ it is everyone’s responsibility to protect the organization’s reputation, data, and customers. 
+ At the state level, national security, and the safety and well-being of the citizens are at stake.
