## The Growth of the Cyber Domains

The data collected within the Internet is considerably more than just the data that the users contribute voluntarily. Cyber domains continue to grow as science and technology evolve, enabling the experts and their employers (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.) to collect many other forms of data. Cyber experts now have the technology to track worldwide weather trends, monitor the oceans, as well as the movement and behavior of people, animals and objects in real time.

New technologies, such as `Geospatial Information Systems (GIS)` and `the Internet of Things (IoT),` have emerged. These new technologies can track the health of trees in a neighborhood. They can provide up-to-date locations of vehicles, devices, individuals and materials. This type of information can save energy, improve efficiencies, and reduce safety risks. Each of these technologies will also result in exponentially expanding the amount of data collected, analyzed and used to understand the world. The data collected by `GIS` and `IoE` poses a tremendous challenge for cybersecurity professionals in the future. The type of data generated by these devices has the potential to enable cyber criminals to gain access to very intimate aspects of daily life.
