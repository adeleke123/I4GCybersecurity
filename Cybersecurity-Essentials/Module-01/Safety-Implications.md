### Safety Implications

Emergency call centers in the U.S. are vulnerable to cyberattacks that could shut down 911 networks, jeopardizing public safety. A telephone denial of service (TDoS) attack uses phone calls against a target telephone network tying up the system and preventing legitimate calls from getting through. Next generation 911 call centers are vulnerable because they use Voice-over-IP (VoIP) systems rather than traditional landlines. In addition to TDoS attacks, these call centers can also be at risk of distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that use many systems to flood the resources of the target making the target unavailable to legitimate users. There are many ways nowadays to request 911 help, from using an app on a smartphone to using a home security system.
