### Cyber Criminal Motives

Cyber criminal profiles and motives have changed over the years. Hacking started in the ‘60s with phone freaking (or phreaking) which refers to using various audio frequencies to manipulate phone systems. In the mid-‘80s, criminals used computer dial-up modems to connect computers to networks and used password-cracking programs to gain access to data. Nowadays, criminals are going beyond just stealing information. Criminals can now use malware and viruses as high tech weapons. However, the greatest motivation for most cyber criminals is financial. Cybercrime has become more lucrative than the illegal drug trade.

General hacker profiles and motives have changed quite a bit. The figure displays modern hacking terms and a brief description of each.
