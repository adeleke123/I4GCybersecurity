## Ransomware

Ransomware holds a computer system, or the data it contains, captive until the target makes a payment. Ransomware usually works by encrypting data in the computer with a key unknown to the user. The user must pay a ransom to the criminals to remove the restriction.

Some other versions of ransomware can take advantage of specific system vulnerabilities to lock down the system. Ransomware propagates as a Trojan horse and is the result of a downloaded file or some software weakness.

Payment through an untraceable payment system is always the criminalâ€™s goal. Once the victim pays, the criminal supplies a program that decrypts the files or sends an unlock code. Click here to read more about ransomware.
