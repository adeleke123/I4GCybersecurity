## Logic Bombs

`A logic bomb` is a malicious program that uses a trigger to awaken the malicious code. For example, triggers can be dates, times, other programs running, or the deletion of a user account. The logic bomb remains inactive until that trigger event happens. Once activated, a logic bomb implements a malicious code that causes harm to a computer. A logic bomb can sabotage database records, erase files, and attack operating systems or applications. Cybersecurity specialists recently discovered logic bombs that attack and destroy the hardware components in a workstation or server including the cooling fans, CPU, memory, hard drives and power supplies. The logic bomb overdrives these devices until they overheat or fail
