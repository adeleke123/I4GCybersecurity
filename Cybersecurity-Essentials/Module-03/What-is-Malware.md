## What is Malware?

Malicious software, or malware, is a term used to describe software designed to disrupt computer operations, or gain access to computer systems, without the user's knowledge or permission. Malware has become an umbrella term used to describe all hostile or intrusive software. The term malware includes computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, scareware, and other malicious programs. Malware may be obvious and simple to identify or it can be very stealthy and almost impossible to detect.
