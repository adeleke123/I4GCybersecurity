## Types of Personal Records
The following examples are just a few sources of data that can come from established organizations.

### Medical Records

Going to the doctor’s office results in the addition of more information to an electronic health record (EHR). The prescription from a family doctor becomes part of the EHR. An EHR includes physical health, mental health, and other personal information that may not be medically related. For example, an individual goes to counseling as a child because of major changes in the family. This will be somewhere in his or her medical records. Besides the medical history and personal information, the EHR may also include information about that person’s family. Several laws address protecting patient records.

Medical devices, such as fitness bands, use the cloud platform to enable wireless transfer, storage and display of clinical data like heart rates, blood pressures and blood sugars. These devices can generate an enormous amount of clinical data that can become part of a medical record.

### Education Records

Education records include information about grades, test scores, attendance, courses taken, awards, degrees awarded, and disciplinary reports. This record may also include contact information, health and immunization records, and special education records, including individualized education programs (IEPs).

### Employment and Financial Records

Employment information can include past employment and performance. Employment records can also include salary and insurance information. Financial records may include information about income and expenditures. Tax records could include paycheck stubs, credit card statements, credit rating and banking information.
