## The Impact of Big Data

Big data is the result of data sets that are large and complex, making traditional data processing applications inadequate. Big data poses both challenges and opportunities based on three dimensions:

+ The volume or amount of data
+ The velocity or speed of data
+ The variety or range of data types and sources
+ There are numerous examples of big corporate hacks in the news. Companies like Target, Home Depot and PayPal are subjects of highly publicized attacks. As a result, enterprise systems require dramatic changes in security product designs and substantial upgrades to technologies and practices. Additionally, governments and industries are introducing more regulations and mandates that require better data protection and security controls to help guard big data.
