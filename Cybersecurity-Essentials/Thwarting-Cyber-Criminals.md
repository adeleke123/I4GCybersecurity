## Thwarting Cyber Criminals
Thwarting the cyber criminals is a difficult task and there is no such thing as a “silver bullet.” However, company, government and international organizations have begun to take coordinated actions to limit or fend off cyber criminals. The coordinated actions include:

+ Creating comprehensive databases of known system vulnerabilities and attack signatures (a unique arrangement of information used to identify an attacker’s attempt to exploit a known vulnerability). Organizations share these databases worldwide to help prepare for and fend off many common attacks.
+ Establishing early warning sensors and alert networks. Due to cost and the impossibility of monitoring every network, organizations monitor high-value targets or create imposters that look like high-value targets. Because these high-value targets are more likely to experience attacks, they warn others of potential attacks.
+ Sharing cyber intelligence information. Business, government agencies and countries now collaborate to share critical information about serious attacks to critical targets in order to prevent similar attacks in other places. Many countries have established cyber intelligence agencies to collaborate worldwide in combating major cyberattacks.
+ Establishing information security management standards among national and international organizations. The ISO 27000 is a good example of these international efforts.
+ Enacting new laws to discourage cyberattacks and data breaches. These laws have severe penalties to punish cyber criminals caught carrying out illegal actions.
