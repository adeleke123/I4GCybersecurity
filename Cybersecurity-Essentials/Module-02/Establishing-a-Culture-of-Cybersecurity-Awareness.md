## Establishing a Culture of Cybersecurity Awareness

The members of an organization must be aware of security policies and have the knowledge to make security part of their day-to-day activities.

An active security awareness program depends on:

+ The organization's environment
+ The level of threat
The creation of a cybersecurity awareness culture is an ongoing effort that requires the leadership of upper management and the commitment of all users and employees. Affecting the cybersecurity culture of an organization starts with the establishment of policies and procedures by management. For example, many organizations have cybersecurity awareness days. Organizations can also post banners and signage to increase overall cybersecurity awareness. The creation of cybersecurity orientation workshops and seminars help to increase awareness.
