## The States of Data
Cyberspace is a domain containing a considerable amount of critically important data; therefore, cybersecurity experts focus on protecting data. The second dimension of the Cybersecurity Cube focuses on the problems of protecting all of the states of data in cyberspace. Data has three possible states:

+ Data in transit
+ Data at rest or in storage
+ Data in process

The protection of cyberspace requires cybersecurity professionals to account for the safeguarding of data in all three states.
