## Controls

`The ISO/IEC 27002` defines information security management system controls. Controls are more detailed than objectives. Control objectives tell the organization what to do. Controls define how to accomplish the objective.

Based on the control objective, to control access to networks by using the appropriate authentication mechanisms for users and equipment, the control would be:

Use strong passwords. A strong password consists of at least eight characters that are a combination of letters, numbers and symbols (@, #, $, %, etc.) if allowed. Passwords are case-sensitive, so a strong password contains letters in both uppercase and lowercase.

Cybersecurity professionals recognize the following:

+ Controls are not mandatory, but they are widely accepted and adopted.
+ Controls must maintain vendor-neutrality to avoid the appearance of endorsing a specific product or company.
+ Controls are like guidelines. This means that there can be more than one way to comply with the objective.
