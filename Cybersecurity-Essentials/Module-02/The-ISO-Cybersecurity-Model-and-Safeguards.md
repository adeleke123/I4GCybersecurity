## The ISO Cybersecurity Model and Safeguards

The ISO 27001 control objectives relate directly to the organizationâ€™s cybersecurity policies, procedures and guidelines which upper management determines. The ISO 27002 controls provide technical direction. For example, upper management establishes a policy specifying the protection of all data coming in to or out of the organization. Implementing the technology to meet the policy objectives would not involve upper management. It is the responsibility of IT professionals to properly implement and configure the equipment used to fulfill the policy directives set by upper management.
