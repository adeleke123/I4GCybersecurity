## Network-based Technology Safeguards

There are several network-based technologies used to protect the organizationâ€™s assets:

+ `Virtual Private Network (VPN)` is a secure virtual network that uses the public network (i.e., the Internet)
.The security of a VPN lies in the encryption of packet content between the endpoints that define the VPN.
+ `Network access control (NAC)` requires a set of checks before allowing a device to connect to a network. Some common checks include up-to-data antivirus software or operating system updates installed.
+ `Wireless access point` security includes the implementation of authentication and encryption.
