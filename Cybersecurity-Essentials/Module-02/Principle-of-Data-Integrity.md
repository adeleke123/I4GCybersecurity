## Principle of Data Integrity

+ `Integrity` is the `accuracy`, `consistency`, and `trustworthiness of data during its entire life cycle`.
+ Another term for integrity is quality. 
+ Data undergoes a number of operations such as 
+ capture, storage, retrieval, update, and transfer. 
+ Data must remain unaltered during all of these operations by unauthorized entities.

+ Methods used to ensure data integrity include `hashing`, 
+ `data validation checks`, `data consistency checks`, and 
+ `access controls`.
+ Data integrity systems can include one or more of the methods listed above.
