## Software-based Technology Safeguards

Software safeguards include programs and services that protect operating systems, databases, and other services operating on workstations, portable devices, and servers. Administrators install software-based countermeasures or safeguards on individual hosts or servers. There are several software-based technologies used to safeguard an organizationâ€™s assets:

+ Software firewalls control remote access to a system. Operating systems typically include a firewall or a user can purchase or download software from a third party.
+ Network and port scanners discover and monitor open ports on a host or server.
Protocol analyzers, or signature analyzers, are devices that collect and examine network traffic. They identify performance problems, detect misconfigurations, identify misbehaving applications, establish baseline and normal traffic patterns, and debug communication problems.
+ Vulnerability scanners are computer programs designed to assess weaknesses on computers or networks.
+ Host-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) examine activity on host systems only. An IDS generates log files and alarm messages when it detects unusual activity. A system storing sensitive data or providing critical services is a candidate for host-based IDS.
