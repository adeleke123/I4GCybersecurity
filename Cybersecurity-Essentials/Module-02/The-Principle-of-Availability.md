## The Principle of Availability

Data availability is the principle used to describe the need to maintain availability of information systems and services at all times. Cyberattacks and system failures can prevent access to information systems and services. For example, interrupting the availability of the website of a competitor by bringing it down may provide an advantage to its rival. These denial-of-service (DoS) attacks threaten system availability and prevent legitimate users from accessing and using information systems when needed.

Methods used to ensure availability include system redundancy, system backups, increased system resiliency, equipment maintenance, up-to-date operating systems and software, and plans in place to recover quickly from unforeseen disasters.
