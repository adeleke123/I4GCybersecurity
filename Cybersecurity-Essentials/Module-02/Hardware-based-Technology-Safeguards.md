## Hardware-based Technology Safeguards

There are several hardware-based technologies used to safeguard an organizationâ€™s assets:

+ Firewall appliances block unwanted traffic. Firewalls contain rules that define the traffic allowed into and out of a network.
+ Dedicated Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) detect signs of attacks or unusual traffic on a network and send an alert.
+ Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) detect signs of attacks or unusual traffic on a network, generate an alert and take corrective actions.
+ Content filtering services control access and transmission of objectionable or offensive content.
