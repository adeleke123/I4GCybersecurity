## Five Nines
People use various information systems in their day-to-day lives. Computers and information systems control communications, transportation and the manufacturing of products. The continuous availability of information systems is imperative to modern life. The term high availability, describes systems designed to avoid downtime. High availability ensures a level of performance for a higher than normal period. High availability systems typically include three design principles (Figure 1):

Eliminate single points of failure
Provide for reliable crossover
Detect failures as they occur
The goal is the ability to continue to operate under extreme conditions, such as during an attack. One of the most popular high availability practices is five nines. The five nines refer to 99.999%. This means that downtime is less than 5.26 minutes per year. Figure 2 provides three approaches to five nines.
