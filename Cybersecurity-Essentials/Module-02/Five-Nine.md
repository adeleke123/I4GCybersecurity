## Five Nines

+ People use various information systems in their day-to-day lives.
+ Computers and information systems control communications, transportation and the manufacturing of products. 
+ The continuous availability of information systems is imperative to modern life. 
+ The term high availability, describes systems designed to avoid downtime. 
+ High availability ensures a level of performance for a higher than normal period. 
+ High availability systems typically include three design principles (Figure 1):

+ Eliminate single points of failure
+ Provide for reliable crossover
+ Detect failures as they occur
+ The goal is the ability to continue to operate under extreme conditions, 
+ such as during an attack. 
+ One of the most popular high availability practices is five nines. 
+ `The five nines refer to 99.999%. This means that downtime is less than 5.26 minutes per year`.
+  Figure 2 provides three approaches to five nines.
