## Standards

Standards help an IT staff maintain consistency in operating the network. Standards documents provide the technologies that specific users or programs need in addition to any program requirements or criteria that an organization must follow. This helps IT staff improve efficiency and simplicity in design, maintenance, and troubleshooting.

One of the most important security principles is consistency. For this reason, it is necessary for organizations to establish standards. Each organization develops standards to support its unique operating environment. For example, an organization establishes a password policy. The standard is that passwords require a minimum of eight upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters, including at least one special character. A user must change a password every 30 days, and a password history of 12 previous passwords ensures that the user creates unique passwords for one year.
