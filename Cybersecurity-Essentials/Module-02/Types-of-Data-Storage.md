## Types of Data Storage

+ Stored data refers to `data at rest`.
+ `Data at rest` means that a type of storage device retains the data 
+ when no user or process is using it. 
+ A storage device can be local (on a computing device) or centralized (on the network). 
+ A number of options exist for storing data.

+ `Direct-attached storage (DAS)` is storage connected to a computer. 
+ A hard drive or USB flash drive is an example of direct-attached storage. 
+ By default, systems are not set up to share direct-attached storage.

+ `Redundant array of independent disks (RAID)` 
+ uses multiple hard drives in an array, 
+ which is a method of combining multiple disks 
+ so that the operating system sees them as a single disk. 
+ RAID provides improved performance and fault tolerance.

+ A network attached storage (NAS) device is a storage device 
+ connected to a network that allows storage and 
+ retrieval of data from a centralized location by authorized network users.
+ NAS devices are flexible and scalable, meaning administrators can increase the capacity as needed.

+ A storage area network (SAN) architecture is a network based storage system. 
+ SAN systems connect to the network 
+ using high-speed interfaces allowing improved performance and 
+ the ability to connect multiple servers to a centralized disk storage repository.

+ Cloud storage is a remote storage option 
+ that uses space on a data center provider and 
+ is accessible from any computer with Internet access. 
+ Google Drive, iCloud, and Dropbox are all examples of cloud storage providers
