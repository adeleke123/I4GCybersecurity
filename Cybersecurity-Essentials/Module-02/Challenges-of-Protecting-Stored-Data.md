## Challenges of Protecting Stored Data

+ Organizations have a challenging task in trying to protect stored data. 
+ In order to improve data storage, organizations can automate and centralize data backups.

+ `Direct-attached storage` can be one of the most difficult 
+ types of data storage to manage and control.
+ Direct-attached storage is vulnerable to malicious attacks on the local host.
+ Stored data may also include `backup data`. 
+ Backups can be manual or automatic. 
+ Organizations should limit the types of data stored on direct-attached storage. 
+ In particular, an organization would not store critical data on direct-attached storage devices.

+ Network storage systems offer a more secure option. 
+ Network storage systems including `RAID`, `SAN` and `NAS`
+ provide greater performance and redundancy. 
+ However, network storage systems are more complicated to configure and manage. 
+ They also handle more data, 
+ posing a greater risk to the organization if the device fails. 
+ The unique challenges of network storage systems include `configuring`, `testing`, and `monitoring the system.`
