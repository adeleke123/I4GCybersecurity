## Protecting Data Privacy

Organizations collect a large amount of data. Much of this data is not sensitive because it is publicly available, like names and telephone numbers. Other data collected, though, is sensitive. Sensitive information is data protected from unauthorized access to safeguard an individual or an organization. There are three types of sensitive information:

Personal information is personally identifiable information (PII) that traces back to an individual. Figure 2 lists this category of data.
Business information is information that includes anything that poses a risk to the organization if discovered by the public or a competitor. Figure 3 lists this category of data.
Classified information is information belonging to a government body classified by its level of sensitivity. Figure 4 lists this category of data.
