## The Principle of Confidentiality

Confidentiality prevents the disclosure of information to unauthorized people, resources and processes. Another term for confidentiality is privacy. Organizations restrict access to ensure that only authorized operators can use data or other network resources. For example, a programmer should not have access to the personal information of all employees.

Organizations need to train employees about best practices in safeguarding sensitive information to protect themselves and the organization from attacks. Methods used to ensure confidentiality include data encryption, authentication, and access control.
