## Methods of Transmitting Data

Data transmission involves sending information from one device to another. There are numerous methods to transmit information between devices including:

+ Sneaker net – uses removable media to physically move data from one computer to another
+ Wired networks – uses cables to transmit data
+ Wireless networks – uses radio waves to transmit data
Organizations will never be able to eliminate the use of a sneaker net.

Wired networks include copper-wired and fiber optic media. Wired networks can serve a local geographical area (Local Area Network) or they can span great distances (Wide Area Networks).

Wireless networks are replacing wired networks. Wireless networks are becoming faster and able to handle more bandwidth. Wireless networks expand the number of guest users with mobile devices on small office home office (SOHO) and enterprise networks.

Both wired and wireless networks use packets or data units. The term packet refers to a unit of data that travels between an origin and a destination on the network. Standard protocols like Internet Protocol (IP) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) define the structure and formation of data packets. These standards are open source and are available to the public. Protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of transmitted data is one of the most important responsibilities of a cybersecurity professional.
