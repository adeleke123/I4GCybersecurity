## Cybersecurity Domains

ISO/IEC 27000 is an information security standard published in 2005 and revised in 2013. ISO publishes the ISO 27000 standards. Even though the standards are not mandatory, most countries use them as a de facto framework for implementing information security.

The ISO 27000 standards describe the implementation of a comprehensive information security management system (ISMS). An ISMS consists of all of the administrative, technical and operational controls to keep information safe within an organization. Twelve independent domains represent the components of the ISO 27000 standard. These twelve domains serve to organize, at a high level, the vast areas of information under the umbrella of information security.

The structure of the ISO cybersecurity model is different from the OSI model in that it uses domains rather than layers to describe the categories for security. The reason for this is that the ISO cybersecurity model is not a hierarchical relationship. It is a peer model in which each domain has a direct relationship with the other domains. The ISO 27000 cybersecurity model is very similar to the OSI model in that it is vital for cybersecurity specialists to understand both of these models to be successful.

The twelve domains serve as a common basis for developing organizational security standards and effective security management practices. They also help to facilitate communication between organizations.
