## Implementing Cybersecurity Education and Training

Investing a lot of money in technology will not make a difference if the people within the organization are the weakest link in cybersecurity. A security awareness program is extremely important for an organization. An employee may not be purposefully malicious but just unaware of what the proper procedures are. There are several ways to implement a formal training program:

+ Make security awareness training a part of the employeeâ€™s onboarding process
+ Tie security awareness to job requirements or performance evaluations
+ Conduct in-person training sessions
+ Complete online courses
Security awareness should be an ongoing process since new threats and techniques are always on the horizon.
