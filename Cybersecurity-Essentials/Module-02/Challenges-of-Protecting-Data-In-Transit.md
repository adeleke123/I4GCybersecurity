## Challenges of Protecting Data In-Transit

The protection of transmitted data is one of the most challenging jobs of a cybersecurity professional. With the growth in mobile and wireless devices, cybersecurity professionals are responsible for protecting massive amounts of data crossing their network on a daily basis. The cybersecurity professional must deal with several challenges in protecting this data:

+ Protecting data confidentiality – cyber criminals can capture, save and steal data in-transit. Cyber professionals must take steps to counter these actions.
+ Protecting data integrity – cyber criminals can intercept and alter data in-transit. Cybersecurity professionals deploy data integrity systems that test the integrity and authenticity of transmitted data to counter these actions.
+ Protecting data availability - cyber criminals can use rogue or unauthorized devices to interrupt data availability. A simple mobile device can pose as a local wireless access point and trick unsuspecting users into associating with the rogue device. The cybercriminal can hijack an authorized connection to a protected service or device. Network security + professionals can implement mutual-authentication systems to counter these actions. Mutual-authentication systems require the user to authenticate to the server, and requests the server to authenticate to the user.
