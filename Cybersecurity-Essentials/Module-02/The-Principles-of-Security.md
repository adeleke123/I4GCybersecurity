These three principles are confidentiality, integrity and availability. The principles provide focus and enable the cybersecurity expert to prioritize actions when protecting any networked system.

Confidentiality prevents the disclosure of information to unauthorized people, resources, or processes. Integrity refers to the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of data. Finally, availability ensures that information is accessible by authorized users when needed. Use the acronym CIA to remember these three principles.
