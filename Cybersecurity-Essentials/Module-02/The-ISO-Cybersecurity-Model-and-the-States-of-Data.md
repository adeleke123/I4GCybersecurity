## The ISO Cybersecurity Model and the States of Data

Different groups within an organization may be responsible for data in each of the various states. For example, the network security group is responsible for data during transmission. Programmers and data entry people are responsible for data during processing. The hardware and server support specialists are responsible for stored data. The ISO Controls specifically address security objectives for data in each of the three states.

In this example, representatives from each of the three groups help to identify the controls that are applicable and the priority of each control in their area. The representative from the network security group identifies the controls ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all data transmitted.
