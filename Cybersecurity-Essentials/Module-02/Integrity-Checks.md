## Integrity Checks

+ An integrity check is a way to measure the consistency of a collection of data (a file, a picture, or a record).
+ The integrity check performs a process called `a hash function` to take a snapshot of data at an instant in time. 
+ The integrity check uses the snapshot to ensure data remains unchanged.

+ A checksum is one example of a hash function. 
+ A checksum verifies the integrity of files, or 
+ strings of characters, before and 
+ after they transfer from one device to another across a local network or the Internet. 
+ Checksums simply convert each piece of information to a value and sum the total. 
+ To test the data integrity, a receiving system just repeats the process. 
+ If the two sums are equal, the data is valid (Figure 1).

+ If they are not equal, a change occurred somewhere along the line (Figure 2).

+ Common hash functions include `MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512.` 
+ These hash functions use complex mathematical algorithms. 
+ The hashed value is simply there for comparison. 
+ For example, after downloading a file, the user can verify the integrity of the file 
+ by comparing the hash values from the source with the one generated by any hash calculator.

+ Organizations use version control to prevent accidental changes by authorized users. 
+ Two users cannot update the same object. Objects can be files, 
+ database records, or transactions. 
+ For example, the first user to open a document has the permission to change that document; 
+ the second person has a read-only version.

+ Accurate backups help to maintain data integrity if data becomes corrupted. 
+ An organization needs to verify its backup process to ensure the integrity of the backup before data loss occurs.

Authorization determines who has access to an organizationâ€™s resources based on their need to know. For example, file permissions and user access controls ensure that only certain users can modify data. An administrator can set permissions for a file to read-only. As a result, a user accessing that file cannot make any changes.
