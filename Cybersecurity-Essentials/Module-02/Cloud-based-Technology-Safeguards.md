## Cloud-based Technology Safeguards

Cloud-based technologies shift the technology component from the organization to the cloud provider. The three main cloud computing services include:

+ `Software as a Service (SaaS)` allows users to gain access to application software and databases. Cloud providers manage the infrastructure. Users store data on the cloud providerâ€™s servers.

+ `Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)` provides virtualized computing resources over the Internet. The provider hosts the hardware, software, servers, and storage components.

+ `Platform as a Service (PaaS)` provides access to the development tools and services used to deliver the applications.
Cloud service providers have extended these options to include `IT as a Service (ITaaS)`, which provides IT support for `IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS service models.` In the `ITaaS model`, an organization contracts with the Cloud provider for individual or bundled services.

Cloud service providers use virtual security appliances that run inside a virtual environment with a pre-packaged, hardened operating system running on virtualized hardware.
