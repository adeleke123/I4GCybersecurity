## Guidelines

Guidelines are a list of suggestions on how to do things more efficiently and securely. They are similar to standards, but are more flexible and are not usually mandatory. Guidelines define how standards are developed and guarantee adherence to general security policies.

Some of the most helpful guidelines make up an organization’s best practices. In addition to an organization’s defined best practices, guidelines are also available from the following:

+ National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Computer Security Resource Center (Figure 1)
+ National Security Agency (NSA) Security Configuration Guides (Figure 2)
+ The Common Criteria standard (Figure 3)
Using the password policy example, a guideline is a suggestion that the user take a phrase like "I have a dream" and convert it to a strong password, Ihv@dr3@m. The user can create other passwords from this phrase by changing the number, moving the symbol, or changing the punctuation mark.
