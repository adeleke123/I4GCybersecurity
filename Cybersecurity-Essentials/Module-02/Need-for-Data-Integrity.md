## Need for Data Integrity

+ `Data integrity` is a fundamental component of information security. 
+ The need for data integrity varies based on how an organization uses data. 
+ For example, Facebook does not verify the data that a user posts in a profile. 
+ A bank or financial organization assigns a higher importance to data integrity than Facebook does. 
+ Transactions and customer accounts must be accurate. 
+ In a healthcare organization, data integrity might be a matter of life or death. 
+ Prescription information must be accurate.
+ Protecting data integrity is a constant challenge for most organizations. 
+ Loss of data integrity can render entire data resources unreliable or unusable.
