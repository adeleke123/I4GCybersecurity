## Need for Data Integrity

Data integrity is a fundamental component of information security. The need for data integrity varies based on how an organization uses data. For example, Facebook does not verify the data that a user posts in a profile. A bank or financial organization assigns a higher importance to data integrity than Facebook does. Transactions and customer accounts must be accurate. In a healthcare organization, data integrity might be a matter of life or death. Prescription information must be accurate.

Protecting data integrity is a constant challenge for most organizations. Loss of data integrity can render entire data resources unreliable or unusable.
