## Forms of Data Processing and Computation

The third state of data is data in process. This refers to data during initial input, modification, computation, or output.

+ Protection of data integrity starts with the initial input of data. Organizations use several methods to collect data, such as manual data entry, scanning forms, file uploads, and data collected from sensors. Each of these methods pose potential threats to data integrity. An example of data corruption during the input process includes data entry errors or disconnected, malfunctioning, or inoperable system sensors. Other examples can include mislabeling and incorrect or mismatched data formats.

+ Data modification refers to any changes to the original data such as users manually modifying data, programs processing and changing data, and equipment failing resulting in data modification. Processes like encoding/decoding, compression/decompression and encryption/decryption are all examples of data modification. Malicious code also results in data corruption.

+ Data corruption also occurs during the data output process. Data output refers to outputting data to printers, electronic displays or directly to other devices. The accuracy of output data is critical because output provides information and influences decision-making. Examples of output data corruption include the incorrect use of data delimiters, incorrect communication configurations, and improperly configured printers.
