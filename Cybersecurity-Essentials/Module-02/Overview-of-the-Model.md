## Overview of the Model

Security professionals need to secure information from end-to-end within the organization. This is a monumental task, and it is unreasonable to expect one individual to have all of the requisite knowledge. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) developed a comprehensive framework to guide information security management. The ISO/IEC cybersecurity model is to cybersecurity professionals what the OSI networking model is to network engineers. Both provide a framework for understanding and approaching complex tasks.
